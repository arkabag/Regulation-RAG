      " NEW YORK STATE MULTIPLE DWELLING LAW INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS; DEFINITIONS ARTICLE 1 ยง1. Short title. This chapter shall be known as the \"multiple dwelling law.\" ยง2. Legislative finding. It is hereby declared that intensive occupation of multiple dwelling sites, overcrowding of multiple dwelling rooms, inadequate provision for light and air, and insufficient protection against the defective provision for escape from fire, and improper sanitation of multiple dwellings in certain areas of the state are a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare, and reasonable comfort of the citizens of the state; and that the establishment and maintenance of proper housing standards requiring sufficient light, air, sanitation and protection from fire hazards are essential to the public welfare. Therefore the provisions hereinafter prescribed are enacted and their necessity in the public interest is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\n",

      " a. Any city, town or village may make local laws, ordinances, resolutions or regulations not less restrictive than those provided in this chapter and may provide for their enforcement by legal or equitable actions or proceedings, and prescribe the penalties, sanctions and remedies for violations thereof. In the enforcement and administration of this chapter in a city of three hundred twenty-five thousand or more persons, the penalties, sanctions and remedies enacted by local law may be applied, notwithstanding their inconsistency with this chapter, or the provisions of this chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      " b. In a city of three hundred twenty-five thousand or more persons, such local laws may authorize such actions or proceedings against the owner, lessee of a whole multiple dwelling, agent or other person having control of such dwelling, and any responsible party, or against the dwelling in rem. Such local laws may further authorize (1) that civil penalties may be enforced against the person liable therefor, and that in addition to the methods of enforcement for judgments established in the civil practice law and rules, a lien may be imposed against the premises and the rents therefrom; (2) that such civil penalties may be enforced against the dwelling by the imposition of a lien against the rents therefrom.\n",

      " 5. Whenever a provision of any local law, ordinance, resolution or regulation is more restrictive in a requirement for height, area or use, such local law, ordinance, resolution or regulation shall govern and take precedence over any lesser requirements of this chapter. When, however, the provisions of this chapter impose more restrictive requirements, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\n",

A \"cellar\" in a dwelling is an enclosed space having more than one-half of its height below the curb level; except that where every part of the building is set back more than twenty-five feet from a street line, the height shall be measured from the adjoining grade elevations calculated from final grade elevations taken at intervals of ten feet around the exterior walls of the building. A cellar shall not be counted as a story.\n",

A \"basement\" is a story partly below the curb level but having at least one-half of its height above the curb level; except that where every part of the building is set back more than twenty-five feet from a street line, the height shall be measured from the adjoining grade elevations calculated from final grade elevations taken at intervals of ten feet around the exterior walls of the building. A basement shall be counted as a story in determining height, except as provided in paragraph e of subdivision six of section one hundred two.\n",

      " ARTICLE 7-B JOINT LIVING-WORK QUARTERS FOR ARTISTS, OR GENERAL RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCY OF LOFT, COMMERCIAL OR MANUFACTURING BUILDINGS ยง275. Legislative findings. It is hereby declared and found that in cities with a population in excess of one million, large numbers of loft, manufacturing, commercial, institutional, public and community facility buildings have lost, and continue to lose, their tenants to more modern premises; and that the untenanted portions of such buildings constitute a potential housing stock within such cities which is capable, when appropriately altered, of accommodating general residential use, thereby contributing to an alleviation of the housing shortage most severely affecting moderate and middle income families, and of accommodating joint living-work quarters for artists by making readily available space which is physically and economically suitable for use by persons regularly engaged in the arts. There is a public purpose to be served by making accommodations readily available for joint living-work quarters for artists for the following reasons: persons regularly engaged in the arts require larger amounts of space for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors and for the storage of the materials therefor and of the products thereof than are regularly to be found in dwellings subject to this article; that the financial remunerations to be obtained from pursuit of a career in the arts are generally small; that as a result of such limited financial remuneration persons regularly engaged in the arts generally find it financially impossible to maintain quarters for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors separate and apart from their places of residence; that the cultural life of cities of more than one million persons within this state and of the state as a whole is enhanced by the residence in such cities of large numbers of persons regularly engaged in the arts; that the high cost of land within such cities makes it particularly difficult for persons regularly engaged in the arts to obtain the use of the amounts of space required for their work as aforesaid; and that the residential use of the space is secondary or accessory to the primary use as a place of work. It is further declared that the legislation governing the alteration of such buildings to accommodate general residential use must of necessity be more restrictive than statutes heretofore in effect, which affected only joint living-work quarters for artists. It is the intention of this legislation to promulgate statewide minimum standards for all alterations of non-residential buildings to residential use, but the legislature is cognizant that the use of such buildings for residential purposes must be consistent with local zoning ordinances. The legislature further recognizes that it is the role of localities to adopt regulations which will define in further detail the manner in which alterations should be carried out where building types and conditions are peculiar to their local environment.\n",
